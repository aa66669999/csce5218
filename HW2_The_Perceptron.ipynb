    "Two views will exlain the reason\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly from the code meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first code snippet represent the process of learning and training from the training example which means updating the weights backpropagation,a mechanism used to update the weights using gradient descent, and minimizing the error between the \"initial value\" passing through the activation function and target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second code snippet using the prediction value (0 or 1)instead of the training value(learning from the activation function) to minimize the error makes no sense. Calculate the error distance with the prediction value and the real target value is not meaningful. We minimize the error with our \"initial value\" passing through the activation function and the target value using backpropagation that will be making sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly from the calculation views:\n",
    "\n",
    "The predict function output 0 or 1. our initial weight is 0 in this code. the second code snippet use predict methed which means the ouptput function is always 1 because sigmoid(0)=0.5 which is >= 0.5 so the output is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accourding to the equation ( weights[i] += lr * error * output * (1-output) * instance[i]), the weight will not be updated correctly as the output is always equal to 1 and the equation will be 0. So the weights will keep 0 and not be updated correctly."

    "In fact, in many cases, training with the entire dataset might not even be feasible due to computational constraints or time limitations.Training on the entire dataset may lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is not diverse enough.Training with all the available training data might improve the model's performance to some extent, but it's not guaranteed to yield the highest accuracy on the test dataset. In many cases, using techniques such as cross-validation or early stopping can help improve the model's generalization performance without requiring training on the entire dataset.\n",
    "The goal is to build a model that generalizes well to unseen data. Achieving the highest accuracy on the training set does not necessarily translate to the highest accuracy on the test set. It’s a balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting)\n",

    "According to the question's example, we can find that the learning rate of first run is 0.05 and the second is 0.005 which means the first is much faster to reach the minimum of loss function( If the learning rate is too large, the training might become unstable or learn a sub-optimal set of weights too quickly). The learning rate like the step size. The second run of the training process may take more epoches to reach reach the minimum of loss function and could get stuck because of the small step size. Then the accuracy will decrease.\n",

    "To summarize, the precision of the model typically enhances with more extensive training sets and a higher number of epochs. However, there are limitations to these improvements. After a certain point, augmenting the number of epochs can lead to overfitting, resulting in a decrease in accuracy on the unseen test dataset. Interestingly, for reasons yet to be fully understood, the accuracy appears to plateau when training on the initial 75% of the data, at least for this particular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the learning rate, it primarily functions to either intensify or dampen these trends, as the weights adjust themselves by larger or smaller increments. In some instances, a learning rate that is too small fails to converge within the given number of epochs for training because the weight adjustments are too minute to reach the minimum. Conversely, a learning rate that is too large fails to converge because the weight changes are too extreme, causing it to overshoot the minimum and land on a higher loss."
